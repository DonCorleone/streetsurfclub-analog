# Bug Fix: Blog Detail Pages Not Working

## Problem
Blog detail pages were not accessible at `/blog/blog-details/:id`. Both locally and on Render.com, clicking on blog post links resulted in 404 errors.

## Root Cause
The blog detail page file was located at:
```
src/app/pages/(blog)/blog-details.[id].page.ts
```

In Analog.js, **parentheses `(folder)` create layout groups** that do NOT add to the URL path. This meant the file was creating a route at:
```
/blog-details/:id
```

But the application was linking to:
```
/blog/blog-details/:id
```

This mismatch caused all detail page navigations to fail.

## Solution
Moved the file from `(blog)/` folder to `blog/` folder:

```bash
# Before
src/app/pages/(blog)/blog-details.[id].page.ts  → /blog-details/:id

# After  
src/app/pages/blog/blog-details.[id].page.ts    → /blog/blog-details/:id
```

## Additional Fixes
1. **TypeScript Configuration**: Added `"composite": true` to `tsconfig.spec.json` to resolve build errors
2. **Updated Documentation**: Corrected routing examples in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

## File Changes
- **Moved**: `src/app/pages/(blog)/blog-details.[id].page.ts` → `src/app/pages/blog/blog-details.[id].page.ts`
- **Updated**: `tsconfig.spec.json` - Added composite flag
- **Updated**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Corrected routing examples

## Verification
```bash
# Build succeeds
npm run build

# Dev server runs correctly
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:5173/blog and click any post
```

## Analog.js Routing Rules Learned
- **`(folder)`** = Layout group, does NOT add to URL
- **`folder/`** = Adds `/folder` to URL path
- **`[param]`** = Dynamic route parameter
- **Example patterns**:
  - `pages/blog.page.ts` → `/blog`
  - `pages/blog/[id].page.ts` → `/blog/:id`
  - `pages/blog/post-[slug].page.ts` → `/blog/post-:slug`
  - `pages/(auth)/login.page.ts` → `/login` (NOT `/auth/login`)

## Deployment Notes
This fix is critical for production deployment. Without it:
- ✅ Homepage loads correctly
- ✅ Blog list page loads correctly  
- ❌ Blog detail pages return 404
- ❌ Users cannot read individual blog posts

After this fix:
- ✅ All routes work correctly
- ✅ Blog post links navigate properly
- ✅ Direct URLs to blog posts resolve correctly
